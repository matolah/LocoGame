## About

LocoGame simplifies the creation and management of game sessions between nearby devices. It is built on top of [Apple's MultipeerConnectivity framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity).

### How it works

LocoGame's core components are:

- `Peer`: a model that contains the information of peers found nearby. It's a friendlier version of `MCPeerID`.
- `PeerMessage`: an enum with all the core messages sent between peers to manage the `MCSession`.
- `ConnectionManager`: manages all the communication between peers. Its main job is to create and maintain `Peer`s from `MCPeerID`s.

`ConnectionManager` has its behavior extended by `GameService`, whose responsibility is to convert the multi-peer session to a game session. Peers can host or join sessions and send `GameMessage`s to one another.

When a game session is created in the `GameService`, a `gameWorker` instance is initialized by `gameWorkerBuilder`. Workers are responsible for encapsulating the business logic of the game mode(s).
